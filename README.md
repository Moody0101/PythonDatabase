# Python database to store passwords

##description:
 to manage the db you run the mainscript in the root dir and the html/css/js and server script are in the dist lib.

## usage
	
	python3 mainscript.py
	that makes a db, then asks for the desired operation to be performed on the db POST/CLEAR/GET
to visualize the data that was added run:
> python3 ./dist/server.py


and that runs the html file that will manage to grab the data from the json file.
